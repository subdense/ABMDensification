# An agent-based model for urban densification

## Discussion for model construction

### [JR] 2025/03/21 first proposal

See JournÃ©e de la Recherche slide for a first rough proposal of a generic model at the urban area scale.
Please provide your feedback here in this discussion.

Dutch simulation model works on ha level, estimating the financial feasibility of redevelopment based on the potential income of various development options minus aquisition, demolition and planning costs. The model allocates a regional demand to the cells where the highest profit can be made (Claassens, Koomen 2024). > No consideration of actor behaviour (necessary?)
However, under which conditions does a cell correspond to market pressures? Meaning, where are people reluctant (or unable) to redevelop even though it would be profitable?
